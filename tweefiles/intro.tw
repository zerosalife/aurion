::approach
You approach your teacher.  She calmly regards you in silence.  You are reluctant to meet her gaze, afraid that she is testing your patience.  She subtly moves an arm, gesturing for you to sit by the fire.

You sit down.  Out of the corner of your eye, you catch movement among the shadows.  An "auroch"?  It can't be.  You would have smelled the beast long before entering the cave.  The shape is unmistakably an auroch, but it moves along the domed wall of the cave.  Your [[gaze is drawn up|gaze-up]].
